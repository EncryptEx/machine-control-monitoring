## Project Overview

This project is the implementation of the **Bobst Company challenge** presented at the LauzHack24 Hackathon. We assembled a 3D printed conveyor belt machine, represent the virtual model in Unity and use a chatbot with a small LLM to also interact with the machine.

**Key Features**:  
- **3D-Printed Conveyor Belt** controlled by a Raspberry Pi.  
- Real-time data collection (speed, box counter, energy usage).  
- AI-powered chatbot for troubleshooting and monitoring via **Ollama's Llama 3.2**.  
- Interactive HMI built in **Unity** for real-time control and visualization.  
- Dockerized architecture for easy deployment.
- Bridge between Unity and Ollama with FastAPI.

## Bob the AI Chatbot  


<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa974f4d-28fc-481a-b16a-9a7cf045e1f4" width="200"/>

Meet **Bob**, our AI-powered assistant built on **Ollama's Llama 3.2**. Bob is integrated into the system, providing real-time assistance, troubleshooting, and even direct control over the conveyor belt.

### üß† How Bob Works  

1. **Understand Context**:  
   Bob uses the machine's current state (e.g., motor status, speed, output metrics) as context for user interactions.

2. **Interpret User Queries**:  
   Natural language queries are passed to Bob along with the machine state for precise and actionable responses.

3. **Execute Actions**:  
   When appropriate, Bob translates its recommendations into **machine actions** via API calls to the Unity that then calls the Raspberry Pi.

## üîÆ Future Improvements
- Add more sensors for enhanced data insights.
- Introduce predictive maintenance using AI.
- Expand HMI with detailed production analytics.

The machine operates with a safety feature that performs a secure stop to prevent accidents when a hand is detected near the belt:

### Setup instructions

1. Clone the Repository:  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:EncryptEx/machine-control-monitoring.git
cd machine-control-monitoring
```

2. Build and run Dockers containers: (form the `chatbot_api` folder)
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Launch Unity Application:<br>
Open the Unity project in your IDE and run the scene.

4. Interact with Bob:<br>
Use the chatbot interface in Unity to troubleshoot and control the conveyor.
