## Project Overview

This project is the implementation of the **Bobst Company challenge** presented at the LauzHack24 Hackathon. We assembled a 3D printed conveyor belt machine, represent the virtual model in Unity and use a chatbot with a small LLM to also interact with the machine.

**Key Features**:  
- **3D-Printed Conveyor Belt** controlled by a Raspberry Pi.  
- Real-time data collection (speed, box counter, energy usage).  
- Integration with **Azure IoT Hub** for seamless monitoring.  
- AI-powered chatbot for troubleshooting and monitoring via **Ollama's Llama 3.2**.  
- Interactive HMI built in **Unity** for real-time control and visualization.  
- Dockerized architecture for easy deployment.
- Bridge between Unity and Ollama with FastAPI
